aboutWindow_Rules_General = On a quadratic game field the players each place a disk in turn. Each side of those disks dyed differently (e.g. black and white). One player (e.g. 'white') places his disks always with the white side facing up while the other player ('black') accordingly the other way around. A player has to place his disk on a empty cell, which adjoins on an already occupied cell either horicontally, vertically or diagonally. If a disk is placed, all opposing disks which are between the newly placed disk and an already placed disk of the same player, will be turned to the other side. Moves which result in no disk turning aren't allowed. The goal of the game is to have the most disks of the own color on the game field once the game has finished. 
aboutWindow_Rules_GameField = Game Field
aboutWindow_Rules_GameField_Text = The game is played on a quadratic field with either 8x8,10x10,12x12,14x14,16x16 cells.
aboutWindow_Rules_DiskNumber = Number of disks
aboutWindow_Rules_DiskNumber_Text = Each player has an opening stock of 32 disks. During the game you can check your number of left disks on the left side:
aboutWindow_Rules_GameStart = Start of game
aboutWindow_Rules_GameStart_Text = In the first two moves both player each place one of their disks on one of the four cells in the middle of the game field. Because of this there can be two initial disk placements, whereat the second player can de facto choose one of them. Afterwards the players place disks alternately. \nIn the following pictures you can see the two different starting variations:
aboutWindow_Rules_PossibleMoves = Rules for placement
aboutWindow_Rules_PossibleMoves_Text = One can place his/her disk only in such a way, that - starting from the newly placed disk - in an arbitray direction (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) one or more opposing diskadjoin and after a disk of the same color. Thus there has to be at least on opposing disk enclosed by the newly placed disk and an already placed disk of the same player in a straight line. \nAll squares between your own two disks must be occupied by opposing disks. In the following picture it is the player's turn to move 'black' and the green dots mark the cells on which he may place his stone:
aboutWindow_Rules_PossibleMoves_Example = All opposing stones that are encircled in this way change colour by being flipped. This is done as part of the same move, before the opponent moves. A move can include several rows of enemy disks at once, which are then all flipped. However, if a stone that has just been flipped includes other opposing stones, they are not flipped. The following picture shows how player 'black' from the picture above made his move by placing his black disk in the upper right corner:
aboutWindow_Rules_GameEnding = End of game
aboutWindow_Rules_GameEnding_Text = As soon as a player has to pass, i.e. when he cannot place any more disks, the game is over. Otherwise, the game is over as soon as all stones are placed on the board. \nThe player who has the most stones of his color on the board at the end wins. If both have the same number, the game is a draw.
